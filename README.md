# React Portfolio

## Description
This project is a simple static portfolio website that uses React and the React-Router to render and change components to create a pseudo-interactive user experience. This site has 4 pages that the user can navigate to, Home (where the user starts), Portfolio (which has multiple project components), Resume (Which is currently just a list of skills), and a Contact page (which does not have full functionality yet).
